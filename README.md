# Bachelor Thesis Scripts

    Joaquin Algorta - unviersidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid
This repository contains the scripts developed for my Bachelor's Thesis. The scripts are organized into three main sections:
1. Analysis of polymorphic marker distribution from DArT-seq raw data.
2. Filtering and preparation of markers for input into the JoinMap5 program.
3. Analysis of population phenotypic data for genetic mapping.
